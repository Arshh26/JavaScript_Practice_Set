Interactive Cart Buttons – HTML + CSS + JavaScript:
This project is a basic interactive web page that allows users to update a shopping cart quantity using buttons. It’s built using HTML, JavaScript, and an optional external CSS file.

Features:
Add to Bag: Increases cart quantity by 1.
Move to Wishlist: Decreases cart quantity by 1.
Add 1+1 Sale item: Increases cart quantity by 2.
Live update: The total number of items in the bag is shown and updated dynamically on the page.

How it Works:
The cartQuantity variable keeps track of the number of items in the cart.
Every button has an onclick event that updates the cartQuantity accordingly.
document.querySelector('#cartSummary') targets the <h1> element to display the updated cart count.

Files Used:
index.html – Main HTML page with buttons and script
index.css (optional) – Linked for custom styling
JavaScript is written directly inside a <script> tag in the HTML
